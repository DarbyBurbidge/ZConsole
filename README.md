## A ZIG Console library using SDL2

### Purpose:
* To get aquainted with the Zig language.
* To learn more about Game development.
* To write a library that I'm comfortable using.
* To practice writing robust, reusable code for others.

As a solo developer I haven't had much experience writing code that other developers will have to work with. As such, I think it's important to work on projects where the intended use is explicit that it will be used by others. 

Inspired by [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com/) and [libtcod](https://libtcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Current Goals:
* Articulate what the key components are (ie renderer, input handler, etc.).
* Figure out exactly where the SDL_Events end and GameEvents start.
* Flesh out how I want people (including myself) to use the library.
